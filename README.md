# Simple-Exploitation
Hello viewers! This will be my very first repository to share with all of you. This aims to inspire all beginner security pen-testers such as myself to never stop learning.

In this, I will be explaining how to exploit a vulnerability in your Metasploitable machine. In this case, we will focus on the "java-rmi" service from the port 1099/tcp. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Using NMAP 

Purpose: To list all the open port 

Objective: For this purpose of exploitation, pay attention to Port: 1099/TCP | Service: java-rmi | Version: GNU ClassPath grmiregistry

1) You'll have to run the command "sudo nmap -sV (the target's IP address) -p-"

2) In this case, my target is the Metasploitable itself, and the IP will be "172.17.0.2".
       
3) -sV means "service version" to list out all the specific versions for the particular service
       
4) -p- is a command for NMAP to scan all the 65000 ports.

Step 2: Unleash the Metasploit Framework

Objective: To find the right exploit for the particular vulnerability


1) To do this you will have to open a new terminal and type the command "msfconsole"
2) And it should show you any random cool looking banner right after.
3) To clear the screen terminal so that you can see it clearly type the command "clear" (Optional)
