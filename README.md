# Simple-Exploitation
Hello viewers! This will be my very first repository to share with all of you. This aims to inspire all beginner security pen-testers such as myself to never stop learning.

In this, I will be explaining how to exploit a vulnerability in your Metasploitable machine. In this case, we will focus on:

--> "java-rmi" service from the port 1099/tcp. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Using NMAP 

Purpose: To list all the open port 

Objective: For this purpose of exploitation, pay attention to Port: 1099/TCP | Service: java-rmi | Version: GNU ClassPath grmiregistry

![Kali NMAP Github](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c47a298-a533-41c5-89ce-25ffdd403f72)

1) You'll have to run the command "sudo nmap -sV (the target's IP address) -p-"

2) In this case, my target is the Metasploitable itself, and the IP will be "172.17.0.2".
       
3) -sV means "service version" to list out all the specific versions for the particular service
       
4) -p- is a command for NMAP to scan all the 65000 ports. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Unleash the Metasploit Framework

 ![Metasploit ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e038caf-baa0-44be-85ca-9adc39cd51c6)


Objective: To find the right exploit for the particular vulnerability


1) To do this you will have to open a new terminal and type the command "msfconsole"
   
2) And it should show you any random cool looking banner right after.
   
3) To clear the screen terminal so that you can see it clearly type the command "clear" (Optional)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Choosing the exploit

![exploit multi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f735eac-478c-4406-b457-d4ad0bd331f6)


1) Type the command "search java_rmi" and press enter. Here this means you are looking for any available possible exploit for the service
 
2) Given options, you will want to choose the very first option which will be the "use exploit/multi/misc/java_rmi_server"
   
3) Therefore, just copy the full command and then type "use " and press enter button.

It will allow you to use the exploitation module, and shows you this below:

![java_rmi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02d12851-883b-4586-8824-8a1a50b9822b)

4) It is recommended to clear the terminal screen by typing "clear" so that you won't be distracted by unnecessary things. (OPTIONAL)
5) To get more information about the exploit, you can type "show info" and it will show you all the information such as the description and the usage commands.
6) And to know what the requirements needed for the exploitation to work, you must type the command "show options" and it will show you the requirements needed.

show info:

show options:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4: Preparing the exploit




According to the given photo, you can see that this exploit requires two requirements:  a) RHOSTS
                                                                                        b) RPORT
                                                                      

                                                                                   


And according to the options given, the payload is based on "reverse/tcp" meaning you will also have to set up your LHOSTS and LPORT

RHOSTS: Stands for Remote Host. In other words, it is the target you want to attack. 

RPORT:  Stands for Remote Port, In other words, it is the target's port you want to attack. 

LHOSTS: Stands for Local Host. In other words, it is your Kali Linux's IP address or your own IP address. 

LPORT:  Stands for Local Port. In other words, it is your Kali Linux's port of your network. 


In this case my target's host and port will be:

RHOSTS = 172.17.0.2

RPORT = 1099


Note: I will show you how to set the RHOSTS, and you can use the same way to set up your own LHOSTS and LPORT. 

![RHOSTS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70fa1668-35a9-40af-8fd0-51ea31359146)

To set up the requirements needed:

1) Type the command, "set RHOSTS 172.17.0.2" (In my case, this will be my metasploitable's IP address. The RHOSTS can be depending on your situation and target.)

Thankfully, the exploit setting itself has already automatically set up the RPORT itself. So we don't have to set it up. However, in some cases, you will have to manually set it up or change the port by yourself. 

NOTE: To set up RPORT or LPORT, type the command "set RPORT (the target's port)", "set LPORT (your network port). As for LHOSTS, the command is similar to RHOSTS but instead of putting the target's IP address into LHOSTS, You have to put your own Kali Linux IP address or network address.

Moving on, to see all the requirements you already prepared. Type the command "clear" to clear the screen and then type "show options" once again to see the updated result. And it will appear just like this below:




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5: Launch the Attack! 

Once all ready and correctly set up 

1) Type the command, "exploit" to launch the attack.
