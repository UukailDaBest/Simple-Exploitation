# Simple-Exploitation
Hello viewers! This will be my very first repository to share with all of you. This aims to inspire all beginner security pen-testers such as myself to never stop learning.

In this, I will be explaining how to exploit a vulnerability in your Metasploitable machine. In this case, we will focus on:

--> "java-rmi" service from the port 1099/tcp. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Using NMAP 

Purpose: To list all the open port 

Objective: For this purpose of exploitation, pay attention to Port: 1099/TCP | Service: java-rmi | Version: GNU ClassPath grmiregistry

1) You'll have to run the command "sudo nmap -sV (the target's IP address) -p-"

2) In this case, my target is the Metasploitable itself, and the IP will be "172.17.0.2".
       
3) -sV means "service version" to list out all the specific versions for the particular service
       
4) -p- is a command for NMAP to scan all the 65000 ports. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Unleash the Metasploit Framework

Objective: To find the right exploit for the particular vulnerability


1) To do this you will have to open a new terminal and type the command "msfconsole"
   
2) And it should show you any random cool looking banner right after.
   
3) To clear the screen terminal so that you can see it clearly type the command "clear" (Optional)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Choosing the exploit

![Auxiliary](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bb9cff3-acc2-4921-8070-59e695e5a728)

1) Type the command "search java_rmi" and press enter. Here this means you are looking for any available possible exploit for the service
 
2) Given options, you will want to choose the very first option which will be the "auxiliary/gather/java_rmi_registry"
   Reason: According to the VERSION of the service it shows it is a"gmiregistry".
   
3) Therefore, just copy the full command and then type "use auxiliary/gather/java_rmi_registry" and press enter button.

It will allow you to use the exploitation module, and shows you this below:

![java_rmi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f25187d-9f58-48ec-bb69-300ff2de573c)

4) It is recommended to clear the terminal screen by typing "clear" so that you won't be distracted by unnecessary things. (OPTIONAL)
5) To get more information about the exploit, you can type "show info" and it will show you all the information such as the description and the usage commands.
6) And to know what the requirements needed for the exploitation to work, you must type the command "show options" and it will show you the requirements needed.

show info:

show options:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4: Preparing the exploit


![showoptions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77d1477f-4c32-4b2a-8eeb-9654387a9f99)

According to the given photo, you can see that this exploit requires only two requirements:  a) RHOSTS
                                                                                             b) RPORT


RHOSTS: Stands for Remote Host. In other words, it is the target you want to attack. 
RPORT:  Stands for Remote Port, In other words, it is the target's port you want to attack. 


In this case my target's host and port will be:

RHOSTS = 172.17.0.2

RPORT = 1099
